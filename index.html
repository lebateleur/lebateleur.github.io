<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/">Programming Principles, Logic, and Verification</a> group at University College London.</p>

<p>My research is in theoretical computer science with a broader focus on the study of open systems arising in various scientific contexts. I favour algebraic tools, in particular those of category theory, with an emphasis on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_category">monoidal (higher) categories</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram">diagrammatic reasoning</a>.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in understanding the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcs.2005.12.075">fundamental structures of concurrency</a>. To this effect, I favour axiomatic reasoning, looking for complete sets of axioms to reason effectively about process equivalence.  Like in particle physics, this involves breaking categories down into their smallest components, finding the fundamental blocks that make them up and the equations that hold between them.</p>

<p>Prior to joining UCL, I obtained my PhD (also known as DPhil) from the University of Oxford under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bob.coecke/">Bob Coecke</a>.</p>
