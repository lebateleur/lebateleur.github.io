I am a postdoctoral researcher in computer science, in the <a href="http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/">Programming Principles, Logic, and Verification</a> group at University College London. I obtained my PhD from the University of Oxford where I was supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bob.coecke/">Bob Coecke</a>.
