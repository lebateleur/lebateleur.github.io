<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in computer science, in the <a href="http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/">Programming Principles, Logic, and Verification</a> group at University College London.</p>

<p>I am interested in the broad idea of composition: how parts interact to form a whole. My favourite tools are those of category theory, with a particular emphasis on monoidal (higher) categories and related structures. My favourite game is to break categories down into their smallest components, finding the fundamental blocks that make them up and the equations that hold between them. In more technical terms, I am interested in presenting monoidal categories in terms of generators and relations.</p>

<p>Prior to joining UCL, I obtained my PhD (also known as DPhil) from the University of Oxford where I was supervised by <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bob.coecke/">Bob Coecke</a>.</p>
