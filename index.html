<p>I am a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/">Programming Principles, Logic, and Verification</a> group at University College London.</p>

<p>My research is in theoretical computer science with a broader focus on the study of open systems arising in various scientific contexts. I employ algebraic tools, in particular those of category theory, with an emphasis on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_category">monoidal (higher) categories</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram">diagrammatic reasoning</a> as a unifying language.</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in understanding the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.entcs.2005.12.075">fundamental structures of concurrency</a>. Whenever possible I favour axiomatic reasoning, looking for complete sets of axioms to reason effectively about system equivalence.  Like in particle physics, this involves breaking categories down into their smallest components and finding the laws that govern their interactions.</p>

<p>Prior to joining UCL, I obtained my PhD (also known as DPhil) from the University of Oxford under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bob.coecke/">Bob Coecke</a>.</p>
