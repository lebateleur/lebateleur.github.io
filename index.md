@def title="Robin Piedeleu"

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Programming Principles, Logic, and Verification](http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/) group at University College London.

My research is in theoretical computer science with a broader focus on the study of open systems arising in various scientific contexts. I employ algebraic tools to reason about their behaviour, in particular those of category theory, with an emphasis on [monoidal (higher) categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_category) and [diagrammatic reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram) as a unifying language. In a nutshell, my aim is to extend algebraic reasoning to structures that are not easily seen as algebraic objects: networks, circuits, automata and more...

These days, I am particularly interested in uncovering the algebra of [probabilistic circuits](https://arranger1044.github.io/probabilistic-circuits/). 

Prior to joining UCL, I obtained my PhD from the University of Oxford under the supervision of [Bob Coecke](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bob.coecke/) and [Samson Abramsky](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/samson.abramsky/)

* March 2024: Datio Stein, Fabio Zanasi, Richard Samuelson, and I wrote [Graphical Quadratic Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02284), introducing a complete axiomatic theory for least-squares problems or, equivalently, Gaussian stochastic processes (potentially extended with non-determinism).
* May 2023: Fabio Zanasi and I wrote an [Introduction to String Diagrams for Computer Scientists](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08768). It has also been accepted for publication by CUP!
* January 2023: I wrote a [blog post](https://piedeleu.com/posts/diagrammatic-causal-inference/) introducing basic causal inference topics with string diagrams.
