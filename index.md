@def title="Robin Piedeleu"

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Programming Principles, Logic, and Verification](http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/) group at University College London.

My research is in theoretical computer science with a broader focus on the study of open systems arising in various scientific contexts. I employ algebraic tools to reason about their behaviour, in particular those of category theory, with an emphasis on [monoidal (higher) categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_category) and [diagrammatic reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram) as a unifying language.

Prior to joining UCL, I obtained my PhD from the University of Oxford under the supervision of [Bob Coecke](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bob.coecke/) and [Samson Abramsky](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/samson.abramsky/)
