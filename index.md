@def title="Robin Piedeleu"

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Programming Principles, Logic, and Verification](http://pplv.cs.ucl.ac.uk/welcome/) group at University College London.

My research is in theoretical computer science with a broader focus on the study of open systems arising in various scientific contexts. I employ algebraic tools to reason about their behaviour, in particular those of category theory, with an emphasis on [monoidal (higher) categories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoidal_category) and [diagrammatic reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_diagram) as a unifying language. In a nutshell, my aim is to extend algebraic reasoning to structures that are not easily seen as algebraic objects: networks, circuits, automata and more...

These days, I am particularly interested in uncovering the algebra of [probabilistic circuits](https://arranger1044.github.io/probabilistic-circuits/). 

Prior to joining UCL, I obtained my PhD from the University of Oxford under the supervision of [Bob Coecke](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/bob.coecke/) and [Samson Abramsky](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/samson.abramsky/)

* 26 February 2025: I gave a talk on probabilistic Boolean circuits in Tallinn, at the [Computing with Markov Categories Workshop](https://www.ioc.ee/~pawel/computingWithMarkov.html) ([slides](https://piedeleu.com/slides/tallinn-workshop-26-2-25.pdf)).
* 12 February 2025: I presented [A Complete Diagrammatic Calculus for Automata Simulation](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.CSL.2025.27) (jww Thibaut Antoine, Alexandra Silva and Fabio Zanasi) at CSL, in Amsterdam ([slides](https://piedeleu.com/slides/automata-simulation-csl25.pdf)).
* January 2025: I wrote a [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18499) on the equational theory of [parity games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_game).
* March 2024: Datio Stein, Fabio Zanasi, Richard Samuelson, and I wrote [Graphical Quadratic Algebra](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02284), introducing a complete axiomatic theory for least-squares problems or, equivalently, Gaussian programming (potentially extended with non-determinism).


> Algebra is the offer made by the devil to the mathematician. The devil says: I will give you this powerful machine, it will answer any question you like. All you need to do is give me your soul: give up geometry and you will have this marvelous machine. â€” Sir Michael Atiyah, 2002
