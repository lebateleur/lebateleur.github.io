<details><summary><strong>Graphical Affine Algebra</strong></summary><p>Graphical linear algebra is a diagrammatic language allowing to reason compositionally about different types of linear computing devices. In this paper, we extend this formalism with a connector for <em>affine</em> behaviour. The extension, which we call graphical affine algebra, is simple but remarkably powerful: it can model systems with richer patterns of behaviour such as mutual exclusion---with modules over the natural numbers as semantic domain---or non-passive electrical components---when considering modules over a certain field. Our main technical contribution is a complete axiomatisation for graphical affine algebra over these two interpretations. We also show, as case studies, how graphical affine algebra captures electrical circuits and the calculus of stateless connectors---a coordination language for distributed systems.</p>

<details><summary><strong>Diagrammatic Algebra: from Linear to Concurrent Systems</strong></summary><p>We introduce the resource calculus, a string diagrammatic language for concurrent systems. Significantly, it uses the same syntax and operational semantics as the signal flow calculus --- an algebraic formalism for signal flow graphs, which is a combinatorial model of computation of interest in control theory. Indeed, our approach stems from the simple but fruitful observation that, by replacing real numbers (modelling signals) with natural numbers (modelling resources) in the operational semantics, concurrent behaviour patterns emerge. 

The resource calculus is canonical: we equip it and its stateful extension with equational theories that characterise the underlying space of definable behaviours---a convex algebraic universe of additive relations---via isomorphisms of categories. 
Finally, we demonstrate that our calculus is sufficiently expressive to capture behaviour definable by classical Petri nets.</p>
