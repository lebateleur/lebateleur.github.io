<p><strong>A Complete Diagrammatic Calculus for Boolean Satisfiability</strong> with Tao Gu and <a href="https://www.zanasi.com/fabio/">Fabio Zanasi</a>, MFPS &#39;22 – <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12629">ArXiv</a></p>
<p>We propose a diagrammatic calculus to reason about satisfiability of Boolean formulas, and prove it to be sound and complete. We then showcase our calculus in a few case studies. First, we consider the relationship of our calculus with resolution proof systems and modern SAT-solving heuristics. Second, we consider Horn clauses, which leads us to a new decision method for propositional logic programs equivalence under Herbrand model semantics.</p>

<p>Graphical &#40;Linear&#41; Algebra is a family of diagrammatic languages allowing to reason about different kinds of subsets of vector spaces compositionally. It has been used to model various application domains, from signal-flow graphs to Petri nets and electrical circuits. In this paper, we introduce to the family its most expressive member to date: Graphical Piecewise-Linear Algebra, a new language to specify piecewise-linear subsets of vector spaces. Like the previous members of the family, it comes with a complete axiomatisation, which means it can be used to reason about the corresponding semantic domain purely equationally, forgetting the set-theoretic interpretation. We show completeness using a single axiom on top of Graphical Polyhedral Algebra, and show that this extension is the small- est that can capture a variety of relevant constructs. Finally, we showcase its use by modelling the behaviour of stateless electronic circuits of ideal elements, a domain that had remained outside the remit of previous diagrammatic languages.</p>
<p><strong>A String Diagrammatic Axiomatisation of Finite-State Automata</strong>, with <a href="https://www.zanasi.com/fabio/">Fabio Zanasi</a>, FoSSaCS &#39;21 – <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14576">ArXiv preprint</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-71995-1_24">DOI</a></p>
<p>We develop a fully diagrammatic approach to the theory of finite-state automata, based on reinterpreting their usual state-transition graphical representation as a two-dimensional syntax of string diagrams. Moreover, we provide an equational theory that completely axiomatises language equivalence in this new setting. The proposed axiomatisation is finitary – a result which is provably impossible to obtain for the one-dimensional syntax of regular expressions.</p>
<p><strong>ERRATUM.</strong>  Unfortunately, this paper contains a mistake in the completeness proof. The implementation of determinisation via equational reasoning does not work as expected in full generality. As a result, we cannot claim completeness of the proposed equational theory. However, it is sill possible to obtain a finite axiomatisation via another route: we have devised an extended syntax equipped with a finite equational theory that is sufficient to prove language equivalence for all diagrams corresponding to automata &#40;<em>i.e.</em> completeness for the fragment of interest&#41;. This axiomatisation has been accepted for publication in LMCS &#40;see <a href="#journal_papers">Journal articles</a> below&#41; and can be found on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16484">ArXiv</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Contextual Equivalence for Signal Flow Graphs</strong>, with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user&#61;RMy4gDsAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en">Filippo Bonchi</a>, <a href="https://www.ioc.ee/~pawel/">Paweł Sobociński</a> and <a href="https://www.zanasi.com/fabio/">Fabio Zanasi</a>,  FOSSACS &#39;20 – <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08874">ArXiv preprint</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-45231-5_5">DOI</a></p>
<p>We extend the signal flow calculus–-a compositional account of the classical signal flow graph model of computation–-to encompass affine behaviour, and furnish it with a novel operational semantics. The increased expressive power allows us to define a canonical notion of contextual equivalence, which we show to coincide with denotational equality. Finally, we characterise the realisable fragment of the calculus: those terms that express the computations of &#40;affine&#41; signal flow graphs.</p>
<p><strong>Bialgebraic Semantics for String Diagrams</strong>, with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user&#61;RMy4gDsAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en">Filippo Bonchi</a>, <a href="https://www.ioc.ee/~pawel/">Paweł Sobociński</a> and <a href="https://www.zanasi.com/fabio/">Fabio Zanasi</a>,  CONCUR &#39;19 – <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01519">ArXiv preprint</a>, <a href="">DOI</a></p>
<p>Turi and Plotkin&#39;s bialgebraic semantics is an abstract approach to specifying the operational semantics of a system, by means of a distributive law between its syntax &#40;encoded as a monad&#41; and its dynamics &#40;an endofunctor&#41;. This setup is instrumental in showing that a semantic specification &#40;a coalgebra&#41; satisfies desirable properties: in particular, that it is compositional. In this work, we use the bialgebraic approach to derive well-behaved structural operational semantics of string diagrams, a graphical syntax that is increasingly used in the study of interacting systems across different disciplines. Our analysis relies on representing the two-dimensional operations underlying string diagrams in various categories as a monad, and their bialgebraic semantics in terms of a distributive law for that monad. </p>

<p>Graphical linear algebra is a diagrammatic language allowing to reason compositionally about different types of linear computing devices. In this paper, we extend this formalism with a connector for affine behaviour. The extension, which we call graphical affine algebra, is simple but remarkably powerful: it can model systems with richer patterns of behaviour such as mutual exclusion–-with modules over the natural numbers as semantic domain–-or non-passive electrical components–-when considering modules over a certain field. Our main technical contribution is a complete axiomatisation for graphical affine algebra over these two interpretations. We also show, as case studies, how graphical affine algebra captures electrical circuits and the calculus of stateless connectors–-a coordination language for distributed systems.</p>
<p><strong>Diagrammatic Algebra: from Linear to Concurrent Systems</strong>, with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user&#61;RMy4gDsAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en">Filippo Bonchi</a>, Josh Holland, <a href="https://www.ioc.ee/~pawel/">Paweł Sobociński</a> and <a href="https://www.zanasi.com/fabio/">Fabio Zanasi</a>,  POPL&#39;19 – <a href="https://piedeleu.com/publications/BHPSZ-popl19.pdf">PDF</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3290338">DOI</a></p>
<p>We introduce the resource calculus, a string diagrammatic language for concurrent systems. Significantly, it uses the same syntax and operational semantics as the signal flow calculus –- an algebraic formalism for signal flow graphs, which is a combinatorial model of computation of interest in control theory. Indeed, our approach stems from the simple but fruitful observation that, by replacing real numbers &#40;modelling signals&#41; with natural numbers &#40;modelling resources&#41; in the operational semantics, concurrent behaviour patterns emerge. The resource calculus is canonical: we equip it and its stateful extension with equational theories that characterise the underlying space of definable behaviours–-a convex algebraic universe of additive relations–-via isomorphisms of categories. Finally, we demonstrate that our calculus is sufficiently expressive to capture behaviour definable by classical Petri nets.</p>

<p><strong>A Finite Axiomatisation of Automata using String Diagrams</strong>, with <a href="https://www.zanasi.com/fabio/">Fabio Zanasi</a>, accepted for publication to LMCS &#40;Special Issue&#41; – <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16484">ArXiv</a></p>
<p>We develop a fully diagrammatic approach to finite-state automata, based on reinterpreting their usual state-transition graphical representation as a two-dimensional syntax of string diagrams. In this setting, we are able to provide a complete equational theory for language equivalence, with two notable features. First, the proposed axiomatisation is finite. Second, the Kleene star is a derived concept, as it can be decomposed into more primitive algebraic blocks.</p>
